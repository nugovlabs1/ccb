The hillside subdivision requirement prescribed by this chapter shall apply to subdivision of land, as defined in this \u0000tle of geographical areas where the natural average slope of the land exceeds ten percent. (Ord. 2085, \u00a7 2 (part), 2011; Ord. 1575, (part), 1991) about:blank 71/8511/28/24, 5:11 PM Print 18.52.020 Purpose. A. The hillside subdivision regula\u0000ons are intended to guide parceling of hillside land in a manner which results in harmony between human development ac\u0000vi\u0000es and the natural environment. To meet that end, the ordinance relies heavily upon the land use policies contained within the City's General Plan. A por\u0000on of the hillside subdivision regula\u0000ons are discre\u0000onary in nature due to the wide varia\u0000on in the natural se\u0000ng of the hillside areas within the community. The hillside development philosophy of the General Plan will therefore aid the Planning Commission and City Council in their review of hillside subdivision proposals. B. The hillside subdivision regula\u0000ons pertain to the parceling of land. The Grading Ordinance, Tree Removal Ordinance, Residen\u0000al Hillside Zoning Ordinance and other general and specific community ordinances also play a role in the regula\u0000on of hillside development. (Ord. 2085, \u00a7 2 (part), 2011; Ord. 1575, (part), 1991) 18.52.030 Lot Design Standards. A. General. The standards listed below shall be u\u0000lized to evaluate the lot configura\u0000on of hillside subdivision applica\u0000ons. The standards augment lot design requirements contained in applicable land use zoning districts. B. Lot Configura\u0000on. 1. The area of each lot shall be of sufficient size to include the house together with required setbacks and yards, adequate space or access drives and off-street parking, sep\u0000c tank systems, if permi\u0000ed, and necessary cut and/or bells. 2. Each lot shall be reviewed for appropriate building pad loca\u0000ons. Appropriate building pad loca\u0000ons shall take into account the ridgeline visibility standards, views from open space, slope of the lot, loca\u0000on to riparian corridors, protec\u0000on of natural vegeta\u0000on, and wildlife migra\u0000on. These issues shall be studied to determine the best building loca\u0000on and mi\u0000gate any nega\u0000ve environmental impacts and meet the building and setback requirements as established in Chapter 19.40, Residen\u0000al Hillside Zones, of this code. 3. The manmade environment (roads, houses, fences) is shaped to a large degree by property lines. Therefore, property lines shall reflect natural land forms to the greatest extent possible. For example, lot lines should follow the natural contour of a hillside, not straight lines drawn for engineering design and surveying convenience. about:blank 72/8511/28/24, 5:11 PM Print C. Clustering Development and Subdivisions. 1. Major Subdivisions in the Five to Twenty Acre Slope Density Designa\u0000on. a. Development lots and major subdivisions in the five to twenty acre slope density designa\u0000on shall be clustered, reserving ninety percent of the land in private open space to protect the unique characteris\u0000cs of the hillsides from adverse environmental impacts. The project shall keep the number of lot clusters minimized, and the open space area con\u0000guous, to the greatest extent possible. The ninety percent private open space can be contained in individual lots regulated by an open space easement or as land held in common as dedicated open space. The project shall keep the open space area con\u0000guous as much as possible. A lot having common ownership, containing the designated open space, will not be counted in the total dwelling unit yield. b. Significant natural features shall be iden\u0000fied on the tenta\u0000ve map: riparian and na\u0000ve vegeta\u0000on including trees, shrubs and ground cover; all topography and areas of slope over thirty percent watercourses; faults; landslides; views of prominent ridgelines; and views from adjacent proper\u0000es. c. As a condi\u0000on of the subdivision, all development except that which is allowed in Chapter 19.88, Open Space Ordinance, of this code, shall be completely contained in the ten percent development area, which should be designed to avoid adversely impac\u0000ng the natural features. The lot sizes will be determined in the review process. The use of the ninety percent open space area shall be limited to their uses allowed in Chapter 19.88, Open Space Ordinance, of this code. 2. Minor Subdivisions in the Five to Twenty Acre Slope Density Designa\u0000on. a. Development of lots and minor subdivisions in the five to twenty acre slope density designa\u0000on are encouraged to be clustered, reserving ninety percent of the land in private open space to protect the unique characteris\u0000cs of the hillsides from adverse environmental impacts. The project shall keep the open space area con\u0000guous, and the number of lot clusters minimized, to the greatest extent possible. The ninety percent private open space can be contained in individual lots regulated by an open space easement or as land held in common as dedicated open space.

All lots shall front on a public street or private driveway as provided in Sec\u0000on 18.32.120. 2. Where the principal frontage of a lot is by means of a corridor, such corridor shall be at least twenty feet wide. A lesser width for a corridor may be approved when a twenty-foot width would not be prac\u0000cal because of exis\u0000ng permanent structures or topography. However, in all cases, the corridor width must be sufficient to accommodate a safe driveway of not less than twelve feet of improved width, and if the length of the corridor is over one hundred fi\u0000y feet, the usable width must be at least eighteen feet. Where two such corridors are combined, the total access width need not exceed thirty feet if each lot has right of access over the corridor of the adjoining lot and the total paved width is not less than eighteen feet.

The setback shall be measured from the top of the bank or from exis\u0000ng riparian vegeta\u0000on, whichever is greater. The setback from riparian vegeta\u0000on will be measured from the drip-line perimeter. The precise area will be established through presenta\u0000on of evidence of the exis\u0000ng or poten\u0000al riparian vegeta\u0000on and wildlife habitat and by considering their rela\u0000onship to all design factors. 3. Lots in minor subdivision are encouraged to be clustered so that development does not encroach on the watercourse. Building sites shall be setback from said watercourse or exis\u0000ng or poten\u0000al riparian vegeta\u0000on a minimum of fi\u0000y feet on lots which are less than one acre in size and one hundred feet on lots which are greater than one acre.

The design of roadways in the hillsides is based upon the General Plan Policy of maintaining the natural environment se\u0000ng of the hillside. In response to the General Plan Policy, public rights of way shall be aligned in a manner to avoid trees and riparian environments. In cases where it is necessary to place rights-of-way on or near ridge tops, grading for the roadways shall be minimized to reduce visual scarring.

The General Plan provides for more flexible improvement standards for hillside developments which have an average lot size of 2.5 acres or greater. Developments that result in less than 2.5 acres per dwelling are labeled \"urban fringe development.\" Conversely, developments that result in 2.5 acres or greater per dwelling unit shall be labeled \"semirural developments.\" The average lot size per acre computa\u0000on shall be based upon the development acreage directly used for residen\u0000al purposes. Land dedicated for public or private open space use in cluster or conven\u0000onal developments should not be counted in the 2.5 acre average lot size standard. A. Urban Fringe Developments. 1. Generally, the street design standards for hillside developments on the valley floor fringe are comparable to the subdivision improvements within the typical urbanized por\u0000on of the community. However, because of varied topography, the right-of-way width and the improvement standards for roadway may vary to minimize degrada\u0000on of the environment. Rights-of-way shall be of sufficient width to provide space for the road bed u\u0000li\u0000es and bicycle lanes and equestrian trails as designated by the General Plan. The City shall maintain slope easements for all fill slopes. The right-of-way for a slope easement shall include an area ten feet below the toe of fill. 2. The minimum right-of-way width and street sec\u0000ons for various func\u0000onal categories of roads are as follows: about:blank 76/8511/28/24, 5:11 PM Print a. Hillside collector right-of-way width shall be fi\u0000y feet with the pavement sec\u0000on to contain thirty feet with three feet of shoulders on each side. b. Major roadways are roads that primarily serve development fron\u0000ng on the road and serving greater than ten dwelling units. The right-of-way shall be forty feet and the pavement width shall be twenty-four feet with three feet of level shoulder space on each side. c. Minor roadways and cul-de-sacs serving less than ten dwelling units shall be thirty feet with a twenty- foot pavement sec\u0000on with three feet of shoulder on each side. d. Private drives may be employed where five or fewer residen\u0000al lots are to be served. The minimum width for a private driveway serving five or fewer dwellings is eighteen feet with three feet of shoulder on either side, with the excep\u0000on that a private driveway serving one dwelling may be twelve feet. B. Semirural Development. 1. The street design standards for semirural development are designed to result in minimal disrup\u0000on to the natural environment.

The size and shape of the frame or base shall be propor\u0000onate to the size and weight of the sign. Low signs are generally more appropriate on a base, whereas taller signs are generally more appropriate in a frame. (See Appendix C, Examples of Well Propor\u0000oned Signs, Examples of Signs Not Well Propor\u0000oned, on file in the City Clerk and the Planning Division, for examples.) B. Ground signs shall be located within a landscaped area propor\u0000onate to the size of the sign. Appropriate landscaping should be placed at the base of the sign. C.

Accessory dwelling units are permi\u0000ed on lots within any residen\u0000al or mixed-use residen\u0000al zoning district. The lot must have an exis\u0000ng single family dwelling unit or if zoned mul\u0000-family or mixed use residen\u0000al, at least one residen\u0000al unit. If the lot is vacant, an accessory dwelling unit may only be proposed in conjunc\u0000on with the development of at least one residen\u0000al unit. Notwithstanding the underlying zoning, an accessory dwelling unit developed pursuant to this chapter does not cause the lot upon which it is located to exceed its maximum the allowable density on the lot. 2. Accessory dwelling units must comply with the site development regula\u0000ons and guideline specified in those zoning districts for dwelling units, including but not limited to: lot coverage; floor area ra\u0000o; height; setbacks; landscape; the regula\u0000ons contained in this chapter; Chapter 19.100, Accessory Structures/Buildings; and Chapter 19.124, Parking; except as those standards are modified by this chapter. 3. No impact fees, as defined in Government Code Sec\u0000on 65852.2(f)(3)(B), shall be imposed on any accessory dwelling unit or junior accessory dwelling unit with a gross floor area of less than 750 square feet. Impact fees imposed on accessory dwelling units greater than or equal to 750 feet shall be charged propor\u0000onally in rela\u0000on to the square footage of the primary dwelling unit in compliance with Government Code Sec\u0000on 65852.2(f)(3)(A). 4. Accessory dwelling units may be rented separately from the single-family dwelling or mul\u0000-family dwelling structure but may not be sold or otherwise conveyed separately from the other dwellings on the lot, except pursuant to Government Code Sec\u0000on 65852.26. Any accessory dwelling unit, including a Junior Accessory Dwelling Unit (JADU), shall not be used as a short-term rental. 5. For JADUs, either the single-family residence or JADU must be owner-occupied, unless the owner is a governmental agency, land trust, or housing organiza\u0000on. Further, the owner shall record a deed restric\u0000on, expressly enforceable against future purchasers, containing the following: (a) a prohibi\u0000on on the sale of the JADU separate from the single-family residence, and (b) a restric\u0000on on the size and a\u0000ributes of the JADU to conform to this sec\u0000on.

The purpose of this chapter is to permit and regulate the conduct of home occupa\u0000ons as an accessory use in a residence, whether owner or renter occupied, and to ensure that such home occupa\u0000ons are compa\u0000ble with the neighborhoods in which they are located. The intent is to protect residen\u0000al areas from adverse effects of ac\u0000vi\u0000es associated with home occupa\u0000ons, while allowing residents of the community to use their homes as a workplace and a source of livelihood under certain condi\u0000ons. B. The City acknowledges that changes in technology and composi\u0000on of the work force, among other factors, have contributed to a growing interest on the part of Cuper\u0000no ci\u0000zens to live and work in their homes. The City also finds that home business enterprises can help reduce commuter-traffic impacts, reduce or eliminate child care expenses for people with young families, and provide the opportunity to test crea\u0000ve business ventures with greatly reduced startup costs.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish applica\u0000on procedures and regula\u0000ons concerning loca\u0000on of adult- related commercial ac\u0000vi\u0000es, as defined herein. These regula\u0000ons are intended to guide future adult-related commercial ac\u0000vi\u0000es and ensure a healthy, func\u0000onal environment for exis\u0000ng and future residents within proposed developments and between adjoining parcels. This chapter is adopted based on the following findings: A. The Council finds that certain uses of real property, specifically adult bookstores, adult mo\u0000on picture theaters, adult cabarets, public dancehalls, and massage parlors, have serious objec\u0000onable characteris\u0000cs, par\u0000cularly when several of such uses are located in close proximity to each other; that such concentra\u0000on tends to create a \"skid row\" atmosphere and has a detrimental effect upon the adjacent area; that regula\u0000on of the loca\u0000ons of these uses is necessary to ensure that such adverse effects will not contribute to the blight or downgrading of neighborhoods or deter or interfere with the opera\u0000on and development of hotels, motels, and lodginghouses, and other businesses which are needed and desirable in the City; and that the regula\u0000ons hereina\u0000er set forth in this chapter are reasonably necessary and will tend to prevent the clustering of such establishments. B. The Council further finds that, although the control of the concentra\u0000on or clustering of the above uses in any one area will tend to prevent the crea\u0000on of \"skid row\" and be otherwise beneficial to the people of the City, it will not prevent the deleterious effect of blight and devalua\u0000on of both business, residen\u0000al, public and quasi- public property resul\u0000ng from the establishment of any of the above-specified uses in a district which is in close proximity to and which serves residen\u0000ally zoned, general planned or used property, or property which is zoned, general planned or used for public or quasi-public uses (i.e., churches, schools, civic buildings, public or private parks and recrea\u0000onal facili\u0000es, etc.); that concern for the orderly planning and development of a neighborhood should be encouraged and fostered in those persons who comprise the business, residen\u0000al, public and quasi- public segments of that neighborhood, and that the regula\u0000ons"}, {"file_name": "Zoning1_CCB_chunk13.txt", "sub_chunk_index": 5, "text": "hereina\u0000er set forth in this chapter restric\u0000ng the about:blank 293/32811/28/24, 5:11 PM Print loca\u0000on of such uses with reference to public, quasi-public or residen\u0000ally zoned, general planned or used property are reasonably necessary and will tend to prevent said deleterious effects.

It is the intent of this chapter to provide for public art on private property without imposing the ar\u0000s\u0000c preferences of the City on the owner or the developer of the property. Ar\u0000s\u0000c preferences are to be primarily those of the owner or developer of the property, but the artwork and its loca\u0000on is subject to approval of the Arts and Culture Commission. A permit required pursuant to Sec\u0000on 19.148.050 shall be granted upon a showing by the applicant that the proposed artwork meets the following criteria: A. The artwork is of a nature specified in Sec\u0000on 19.148.030. about:blank 316/32811/28/24, 5:11 PM Print B. The artwork requirement is to be sa\u0000sfied with one significant piece of artwork, except that the requirement may be met with several works of art when specifically found by the Arts and Culture Commission to fulfill the intent of this chapter. The artwork shall be an integral part of the landscaping and/or architecture of the buildings. C. The artwork shall be easily visible from the public street and be located in an area specifically designated on the project site plan. Appropriate loca\u0000ons include, but are not limited to, entryways to the property, greenbelts, and building exteriors. The artwork must be in permanent view to motorists and pedestrians. Artwork located at the entrance to a development should make a major statement and be visible from the main parking lot, if any. When located in proximity to major traffic thoroughfares, the artwork should be at a motorist's scale and oriented toward the view corridor of the motorist. D. Artwork located along Stevens Creek Boulevard or De Anza Boulevard corridors shall be large in scale and oriented to the view corridors of the motorist. Appropriate artwork in these corridors will most likely be sculptural: however, other forms of art may be considered if consistent with the intent of this chapter. Artwork should have a visual impact upon passengers in a moving vehicle or pedestrians not less than 100 feet away. E. The composi\u0000on of the artwork shall be of permanent materials requiring a low level of maintenance. Materials used shall be durable and resistant to graffi\u0000 and the effects of weather. F. The nature and style of the artwork shall be considered in the context of other artwork in the surrounding area in order to encourage a wide range of art styles and materials, and to create a balanced and interes\u0000ng aesthe\u0000c appearance. The developer is encouraged to give preference to ar\u0000sts living or working in the San Francisco Bay area, and to avoid using ar\u0000sts whose work is already displayed as public art within the City of Cuper\u0000no boundaries. G. Because the artwork will necessarily be highly visible to the public and be associated with City requirements, expressions of obvious bad taste or profanity shall not be approved. H. Water and/or electronic sculpture may be permi\u0000ed if adequate assurance of con\u0000nued maintenance is provided. I. Artwork shall be iden\u0000fied by an appropriate plaque or monument measuring not less than eight inches by eight inches. The plaque shall be made of a durable, permanent material and shall be placed near the artwork, and shall list the date of installa\u0000on, \u0000tle and ar\u0000st, and medium. J. The artwork shall be a permanent, maintained fixed asset of the property, and statements to this fact shall be a\u0000ached or recorded to the exis\u0000ng CC&R's or otherwise recorded on the property deed, to advise subsequent property owners of their obliga\u0000ons to maintain the artwork. K. The proposed artwork shall meet the criteria for review as set forth in the City of Cuper\u0000no Public Art Program Guidelines for Selec\u0000on of Public Art, as originally adopted by the City Council Resolu\u0000on No. 05-040, or as later amended. L. The ar\u0000st's qualifica\u0000ons will be evaluated and examples of past work may be reviewed. The review, however, shall be primarily for the purpose of determining the ar\u0000st's experience with artwork of monumental propor\u0000on.

Maintenance shall include all related landscaping, ligh\u0000ng, and upkeep, including the iden\u0000fica\u0000on plaque.

Encourage the development and availability of housing affordable to a broad range of households with varying income levels within the city as mandated by State Law, California Government Code Sec\u0000ons 65580 and the City of Cuper\u0000no's General Plan, including its Housing Element. B. Promote the city's goal to add affordable housing units to the city's housing stock in propor\u0000on to the overall increase in new jobs and market rate housing units. C. Mi\u0000gate the need for affordable housing created by new market-rate housing development and ensure that market-rate housing development does not u\u0000lize all land available in the city for affordable housing. D. Mi\u0000gate environmental and other impacts that accompany new residen\u0000al and commercial development by protec\u0000ng the economic diversity of the city's housing stock, with the goal of reducing traffic, transit and related air quality impacts, promo\u0000ng jobs/housing balance and reducing the demands placed on transporta\u0000on infrastructure in the region. E. Increase the supply of for-sale and rental housing for families and individuals employed in Cuper\u0000no whose incomes are insufficient to afford market rate housing. Since the historical rate of produc\u0000on of affordable housing in the city, by private developers is very low, the BMR program is essen\u0000al to meet the city's need for affordable housing. about:blank 326/32811/28/24, 5:11 PM Print (Ord. 14-2125, \u00a7 11 (part), 2014) 19.172.020 Below Market Rate (BMR) Housing Program Requirements.

Two story homes with a second story to first floor ra\u0000o greater than 66% and homes with second story side setbacks less than 15 feet must offset the building massing with designs that encompass higher quality architectural features and materials. Design Principles These design principles help integrate new homes and addi\u0000ons to exis\u0000ng homes with exis\u0000ng neighborhoods by providing a framework for the review and approval process. Where possible, addi\u0000onal details and examples have been provided. Condi\u0000ons not covered by these examples will be evaluated on a case-by-cases basis. 1. Provide an iden\u0000fiable architectural style. A\u0000rac\u0000ve homes are designed by using elements from one consistent theme. It is best to work with your designer to iden\u0000fy and carry out one style around the en\u0000re house. 2. Design features.

The purpose of the RHS zoning district is to regulate development consistent with the General Plan, to preserve the natural se\u0000ng in the hillsides. This chapter u\u0000lizes performance standards and specific regula\u0000ons to ensure that the u\u0000liza\u0000on of land for residen\u0000al uses is balanced with the need to conserve natural resources and protect life and property from natural hazards. Specifically, this chapter is intended to accomplish the following objec\u0000ves: A. Enhance the iden\u0000ty of residen\u0000al neighborhoods; B. Ensure the provision of light and air to individual residen\u0000al parcels; C. Ensure a reasonable level of compa\u0000bility in scale of structures within residen\u0000al neighborhoods; D. Maintain spa\u0000al rela\u0000onship between structures and within neighborhoods; E. Reinforce the predominantly low-intensity se\u0000ng of the community; F. Maintain a balance between residen\u0000al development and preserva\u0000on of the natural hillside se\u0000ng; G. Promote compa\u0000bility of colors and materials of structures and the surrounding natural se\u0000ng.

Planned development zoning districts may be established, modified or removed from the zoning map, and the regula\u0000ons applicable to any planned development district may be established, modified or deleted in accord with the procedures described in this chapter. B. All P districts shall be iden\u0000fied on the zoning map with the le\u0000er coding \"P\" followed by a specific reference to the general type of use allowed in the par\u0000cular planned development zoning district. For example, a planned development zoning district in which the uses are to be general commercial in nature, would be designated P(CG). A planned development zoning district in which the uses are intended to be a mix of general commercial and residen\u0000al would be designated P(CG, Res) or any combina\u0000on of residen\u0000al zoning district such as P(CG, R-3), P(CG, R-4), or if combined with the TH combining district, P(CG,R-3/TH) or P(CG, R-4/TH). C. Permi\u0000ed uses in a P zoning district shall consist of all uses which are permi\u0000ed in the zoning district referenced following the le\u0000er \"P\", unless a conceptual development plan, specific plan, or other zoning plan, further restricts the uses, subject to the limita\u0000ons of state law. For example, the permi\u0000ed uses in a P(CG) zoning district are the same uses which are permi\u0000ed in the CG zoning district. The permi\u0000ed uses in the P(Res) zoning district are the same uses which are permi\u0000ed in the type of housing structure that the use is going to occupy (i.e., follow R-1 permi\u0000ed uses for single family homes in P(Res) zoning district, follow R-3 permi\u0000ed uses in mul\u0000ple-family units in P(Res) zoning district). For sites with a mixed-use residen\u0000al designa\u0000on, Sec\u0000on 19.80.030E shall also apply. D. Condi\u0000onal uses in a P zoning district shall consist of all uses which require the issuance of a condi\u0000onal use permit in the zoning district referenced following the le\u0000er \"P,\" unless a conceptual development plan, specific plan, or other zoning plan, further restricts the uses. For example, the condi\u0000onal uses in a P(CG) zoning district are the same uses which require a condi\u0000onal use permit in the CG zoning district. Each condi\u0000onal use in a P zoning district requires a separate condi\u0000onal use permit. For sites with a mixed-use residen\u0000al designa\u0000on, Sec\u0000on 19.80.030E shall apply. E. For sites with a mixed-use residen\u0000al designa\u0000on the following shall apply: 1. For sites in the Monta Vista Village Special Area, residen\u0000al shall be a permi\u0000ed use. 2. If a site is listed as a Priority Housing Site in the City's adopted Housing Element of the General Plan, then residen\u0000al development consistent with the maximum and minimum density specified for the site shall be a permi\u0000ed use. 3. Priority Housing Sites shall be shown on the City's zoning map. 4. For sites zoned P(CG, R-3), P(CG, R-3/TH), P(CG, R-4), or P(CG, R-4/TH), no conceptual or defini\u0000ve plans shall be required to establish permi\u0000ed and condi\u0000onal uses. Mul\u0000ple-family residen\u0000al use is the primary permi\u0000ed use, with all other permi\u0000ed uses in that residen\u0000al zoning district allowed as well. Commercial uses may be incorporated into the development on the first floor but shall not be the primary permi\u0000ed use of the structure. F. The development standards and regula\u0000ons for residen\u0000al only and mixed-use residen\u0000al projects in a P zoning district shall consist of the following: 1. All relevant development standards and regula\u0000ons in the General Plan and any adopted specific plan, conceptual development plan, defini\u0000ve plan, or other zoning plan, and, to the extent not addressed in those plans, all development standards and regula\u0000ons for the zoning district referenced following the le\u0000er \"P.\" The development standards and regula\u0000ons for a residen\u0000al development are those established for the R-3 or R-4 zoning districts and/or the TH combining district. 2. In implemen\u0000ng subsec\u0000on (1) above, mixed-use projects shall comply with the development standards and regula\u0000ons in the R-3 or R-4 zone and/or the TH combining district, and the referenced zoning district by about:blank 199/32811/28/24, 5:11 PM Print proposed use.

For projects with no residen\u0000al component proposed in a P zoning district, the development standards and regula\u0000ons of the permi\u0000ed and condi\u0000onal uses shall be established in conjunc\u0000on with the approval of conceptual and defini\u0000ve plans, and such projects shall also comply with any adopted specific plan, or other zoning plan. For sites which require a specific plan prior to development approval, the permi\u0000ed and condi\u0000onal uses and all development regula\u0000ons shall be as shown in the specific plan.

B. The FP zoning district is intended to encourage a diverse range of recrea\u0000onal development by private interests. At the same \u0000me, the use intensity of any site in the FP zone is determined by applica\u0000on of performance standards which ensure a compa\u0000ble fit with the site's geographic and environmental se\u0000ng.
